# Hate_Speech_Detection

The purpose of the project was to solve , known as *TSP*, by using a [Genetic Algorithms](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/documents/courses/GeneticAlgorithm-tutorial.pdf) approach and exploit parallelism. In addition to the sequential version used as a baseline, two parallel versions were developed, one using standard C++ threads and one using [Fastflow](https://github.com/fastflow/fastflow#fastflow-high-performance-parallel-patterns-and-building-blocks-in-c). More information about the project and the design of the parallel versions can be found in the [report](https://github.com/FraCorti/TSP-GeneticAlgorithm/blob/master/report.pdf).


## Running the project
